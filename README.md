# Sushi-FrontEnd

The coursework is aimed at creating the front-end of a program named Sushi which handles food delivery orders.

## Coursework Goals:

- Learn to create basic JavaFx UIs
- Learn how to seperate the front and back-end of an program by creating 'dummy' terporary databases
- Learn how to handle data input from files as well as learning how to store data that is important when loading the program
- Learn how to create and maintain a MAVEN project

## Coursework Prompt

A new sushi delivery business has just been opened in a busy university city. This business keeps stocks of ingredients sourced from local suppliers and uses these to prepare different types of sushi dishes. Each of these sushi dishes is prepared according to a recipe that specifies which ingredients (and how much) to use. Due to significant and predictable demand from the student population, the business also keeps stocks of prepared sushi. Stocks of ingredients and prepared sushi are always kept at specific minimum target levels set by the business.

What sets this business apart from other similar competitors is a fleet of delivery drones (small autonomous aerial vehicles). These fulfil two purposes: they deliver prepared sushi dishes to the customers and they collect new ingredients when stocks are low.

Your objective across both the first coursework and the second is to implement an inventory and delivery management system for the sushi business. This will keep track of stocks of ingredients and the sushi that has been prepared from these ingredients. It will also manage the fleet of drones for delivering sushi and restocking ingredients. Finally, you will implement client functionality which allows customers to view the range of sushi on offer, to place orders and to view the progress of their order.

In this first part, your focus is on building the front-end and user interface for the Server. The second part of the coursework will involve building the back-end and logic to the application.
